This game was made as a college project. It was written in C++ using Allegro 4 library. It's an arcade where you'll have to take control of a ship and destroy all the enemy ships before they destroy you. The game is not complete because I had to turned it in, however it is playable and you'll probably enjoy it. A lot of enemy ships will come and attack you so you'll have to come with an strategy in order to reach the higher levels.
